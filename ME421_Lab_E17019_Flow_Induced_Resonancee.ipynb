And also this behavior is called as dynamic instability.Tipically in damping which has a force opposes the velocity but this cases whichever direction wood moves in whatever sirection it has a velocity and it gets an extra push in that same direction .if it has a downward velocity .it is gets downward force .if it has a upward velocity it is get a upward force. So that phenomena is called dynamic instability or self excited vibration"

        "#02) Derive a finite dimensional approximation of the small amplitude motion of the system\n",
        "Flow-induced resonance (FIR) is a phenomenon that occurs when a fluid flow interacts with a flexible structure, causing the structure to vibrate at its natural frequency. where a two-dimensional structure is placed perpendicular to a uniform flow.\n",
        "\n",
        "To derive a finite dimensional approximation of the small amplitude motion of the FIR of the half cross section, we can use the linearized equations of motion, they take the form of a system of partial differential equations.\n",

        "To obtain a finite dimensional approximation, we need to discretize the equations of motion by approximating the continuous structure as a set of discrete elements. We can then write the equations of motion in terms of the displacements of these degrees of freedom.\n",
        "\n",
        "use a finite element method, which involves dividing the structure into a set of finite elements and approximating the displacements within each element using a set of basis functions. The basis functions are chosen to satisfy the boundary conditions at the nodes of the elements, and the displacement field is interpolated between the nodes using these basis functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the structure has been discretized, we can use the linearized equations of motion to derive a set of linear algebraic equations that relate the displacements of the degrees of freedom to the fluid forces acting on the structure. These equations take the form of a matrix equation, where the coefficients of the matrix depend on the properties of the structure and the fluid flow.\n",

        "To obtain a finite dimensional approximation of the small amplitude motion of the FIR, we can then solve this matrix equation numerically using a suitable solver, such as an eigensolver, to find the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the structure. These quantities can be used to predict the response of the structure to different flow conditions and to design structures that are less prone to FIR."

        "One of the most effective ways to safely operate at frequencies near the second mode of resonance is to add damping to the system. Damping can help to reduce the amplitude of the vibrations by dissipating the energy of the vibrations as heat. Damping can be added to the system using various techniques, including adding viscous dampers, friction dampers, or tuned mass dampers. These dampers work by introducing energy dissipation into the system, which reduces the amplitude of the vibrations and allows safe operation at frequencies near the second mode of resonance.\n",

        "\n",
        "Another way to safely operate at frequencies near the second mode of resonance is to increase the stiffness of the system. By increasing the stiffness of the structure, the natural frequency of the system can be increased, which can help to shift the second mode of resonance to a higher frequency. This can be achieved by adding stiffening elements such as braces, struts, or beams. However, it is important to note that increasing the stiffness can also increase the stresses in the structure, which may need to be carefully considered to ensure safe operation."
